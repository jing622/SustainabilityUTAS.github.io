As you walk along the trail try and spot as many species as you can and enjoy some time in nature. <br>The trail is named after the late Thomas Crawford who attended the University in the 1960s and was struck by his experiences in the Tasmanian environment. Crawford's bequest enables students from around the world to experience and enjoy the same pleasure he had walking through the campus.<br><br>Find out more about <a href='http://www.utas.edu.au/infrastructure-services-development/sustainability/natural-environment' target='_blank'>threatened species</a> on University of Tasmania property and ways to get involved through citizen science on our website. <br><br>NB please be aware of uneven terrain, there may be biting insects such as jack jumpers and take precautions if you have pollen allergies.",

The hub has separate collection units for toothbrushes & toothpaste tubes, printer and toner cartridges, pens, bread tags, mobile phones, batteries, contact lenses, blister packs and small e-waste. The items are processed either locally or sent for free to mainland facilities.<br><br>This service got its start through the work of 2019 SIPS students Christoff Kartzoff and Joy Pfleger and their staff mentor Jasper McCormack. The current sustainability projects officer Will Plaister has now taken over this role and will oversee the expansion of this project to include more campuses. <br><br> If your school, college or building would like to be considered for a recycling hub or for more information about the pilot program please

Roger’s intentions for Mavis is to start a conversation around the displacement on animals into foreign habitat due to climate change. <br> Climate change has accelerated the movement of animals around the world. It is estimated that marine species are moving at a much faster rate than terrestrial animals. This creates a whole new array of ecological problems such as extinction, exposure to new diseases, local niche changes, birth of hybrids with interbreeding and more <a href='https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/04/climate-change-species-migration-disease/' target='_blank'>(National Geographic)</a>. <br><br><br> Update: Mavis had to be moved temporarily due to the current construction at Inveresk.",

The repurposing of the heritage listed building from 1951, in 2007, presented an opportunity to both maintain its iconic exterior shed structure but also upgrade and improve on its sustainable performance as a teaching space. <br><br> The ground floor of the building is raised to accommodate a ‘thermal labyrinth’ of brick walls which provide cooling and heating to the teaching spaces. Heating of the building is also supplied by an air-sourced heat pump with gas boost, which has an estimate 10-year payback and an 85% reduction in greenhouse gase emissions compared to natural gas boilers. <br><br>The walls and ceilings were redesigned with plantation hoop pine plywood. Flooded gum plywood and rubber was used for flooring. Other sustainable materials used in the upgrade included metal and fiberglass wall cladding and carpets with post-consumer recycled content. <br><br>A recent initiative at the school is a vegetable garden maintained by the staff and students. Water for the garden, toilet flushing, and cleaning is collected in four 22,700L rainwater tanks. <br><br>Read more about the <a href='https://secure.utas.edu.au/commercial-services-development/sustainability/constructed-environment' target='_blank'>University’s sustainable built environment</a> on our website.",
