As you walk along the trail try and spot as many species as you can and enjoy some time in nature. <br>The trail is named after the late Thomas Crawford who attended the University in the 1960s and was struck by his experiences in the Tasmanian environment. Crawford's bequest enables students from around the world to experience and enjoy the same pleasure he had walking through the campus.<br><br>Find out more about <a href='http://www.utas.edu.au/infrastructure-services-development/sustainability/natural-environment' target='_blank'>threatened species</a> on University of Tasmania property and ways to get involved through citizen science on our website. <br><br>NB please be aware of uneven terrain, there may be biting insects such as jack jumpers and take precautions if you have pollen allergies.",
